	<p style="font-size:17px; font-family:Cooper black"><b style="color:#89bdd3; font-size:18px;">Enhancing girls’ futures and reducing social inequalities:</b><p style="color:#89bdd3;">
 Computing jobs 
are among the fastest-growing and highest-paying, yet few women are benefiting 
from these occupations (U.S. Dept. of Labor, 2010a, 2010b). This trend potentially 
exacerbates existing social inequalities and barriers to girls’ future life opportunities. 
Increasing girls’ participation in computing is important for promoting equity and 
ensuring that girls are able to take advantage of these jobs and the opportunities 
they make possible (Barker & Aspray, 2006; Margolis, et al., 2011; Miliszewska & 
Sztendur, 2010; Teague, 2002)<br><br><tr></tr></p>
<p style="color:#89bdd3;">Men have long dominated the technology industry, but the growing number of women entrepreneurs and business leaders can't be ignored. The most notable recent example is Marissa Mayer, Google's first female engineer who was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo Inc.</p><a href="../pages/page4.html">click here for more information </a></p>
